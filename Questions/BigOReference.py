# In the WORST CASE scenario, what is the total number of items it would have to look at
# log(n) halves every time
# [1,2,3], t = length of this array
# O(t)


# log(n) (ie: Binary search)
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# [1,2,3,4]
# [3,4]
# 3


# O(1) => HashMap (Dictionaries)
# Value -> Apply a Hash Function -> Store it in the place where the hash belongs
# [1 -> "banana", "apple", 45, 47, etc...]
# O(n)


# O(n * log(n))
# Merge sort
# For each item in the array, it does a sort function that is O(log(n))
# [2,1,3,5,4]


# O(n!) -> Traveling Salesman
# Given a starting point and endpoint, what are ALL the possible routes the salesman could take


# O(1)
# O(log(n))
# O(n)
# O(n * log(n))
# O(n^2)
# O(n!)
